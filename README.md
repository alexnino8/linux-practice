# Linux Backup Script

This project is a basic Bash automation tool that backs up your `Documents` folder into a dated folder inside a `backups` directory. It's part of my learning journey to master Linux shell scripting and DevOps fundamentals.

## Key Features
- Automatically creates a backup folder with todayâ€™s date
- Copies files from your `Documents` folder
- Easily extendable to other folders 
- Can be scheduled to run automatically using `cron`

## What I Learned
- Linux command-line basics (mkdir, cp, chmod, etc.)
- Bash scripting with variables and date formatting
- Editing files with nano
- Making scripts executable and reusable
- Automating tasks with `cron`
- Pushing code to GitHub using Git
